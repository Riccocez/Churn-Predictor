# Churn-Predictor Model using Multi-class Logistic Regression

These code contains a churn predictor model capable of cluster random drivers into three classes of churn:
  1) Low Churn
  2) Medium Churn
  3) High Churn
  
  
The Main code, together with a detailed explanation of 3 churn predictor models, can be found in the notebook Main.ipynb.

Classes used are included in:

            - Dataset.py
            - Predictor.oy
            - Randomness.py
            - Visualization.py

The dataset implemented is contained in the dump_dataset.json file. This data was randomly generated, therefore, data 
does not include real records.
